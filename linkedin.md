# LinkedIn Post for Seeva

## Main Post (Non-Developer Friendly ✓)

I got tired of dragging screenshots to AI tools 50 times a day.

So I built Seeva.

Press a shortcut (Cmd+Shift+C) → AI appears instantly
One click → It sees your screen
Ask anything → Get answer
Press shortcut again → Gone

Works everywhere. Browser, email, any app.

Privacy-focused. Everything stays on your computer.

Early version. Mac-only for now. Open-source (free to use and modify).

Made it because I needed it. Sharing to see if it helps anyone else.

Let me know what you think.

## Alternative Version (If you want to mention Claude specifically)

I got tired of switching to Claude 50 times a day just to ask a question.

Every time I needed help:
- Stop what I'm doing
- Open browser
- Find the AI tab
- Screenshot what I'm looking at
- Drag it in
- Type my question
- Switch back

So I built Seeva — an AI assistant that's just... always there.

Press Cmd+Shift+C anywhere → It appears
Click once → It sees your screen
Ask your question → Get answer
Press Cmd+Shift+C → Gone

Works everywhere: writing emails, browsing, working in any app.

Everything stays on your computer. Privacy-focused.

Early version. Mac-only. Open-source.

Made it for myself. Sharing to see if anyone else finds it useful.

## First Comment (Post immediately after)

Quick setup:

1. Download and run the app
2. Add your AI provider key (works with Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, or local AI)
3. Allow screen recording when prompted

Everything runs on your computer. No data sent anywhere except to your chosen AI.

Built this for myself, so genuinely curious:
- What would make this more useful?
- What's missing?
- What doesn't work for you?

Open to all feedback.

## First Comment - Developer Version

For developers who want to run from source:

```
bun install && bun run tauri dev
```

Add your API key in Settings (Claude/OpenAI/Gemini/Ollama)
Grant screen recording permissions

Everything runs locally. No tracking. No telemetry.

What features should I add next?

## Language Check - Easy for Non-Developers ✓

**Changed technical terms:**
- ❌ "Claude" → ✓ "AI tools" (then mention Claude in context)
- ❌ "API key" → ✓ "AI provider key" (clearer)
- ❌ "Tauri + Rust" → ✓ Removed (not relevant to users)
- ❌ "v0.1.0" → ✓ "Early version" (no jargon)
- ❌ "Local storage" → ✓ "Everything stays on your computer"
- ❌ "No telemetry" → ✓ "No tracking"

**Kept simple:**
- ✓ "Press a shortcut" instead of just "Cmd+Shift+C"
- ✓ "It sees your screen" instead of "screen capture"
- ✓ "Open-source (free to use and modify)" - explains what it means
- ✓ Short sentences, clear actions

**No arrogance:**
- ✓ "I got tired" (personal experience)
- ✓ "Made it because I needed it" (honest motivation)
- ✓ "Sharing to see if it helps" (offering, not claiming)
- ✓ "Let me know what you think" (inviting feedback)
- ✗ NO words like: Revolutionary, Game-changing, Must-have, Best, Everyone needs

### Recording Checklist

**Before recording:**
- ✓ Clean desktop (close unnecessary apps)
- ✓ Hide menu bar extras (keep it minimal)
- ✓ Turn on Do Not Disturb (no notifications)
- ✓ Use dark mode (looks better in videos)
- ✓ Prepare the exact questions you'll type
- ✓ Test Seeva to make sure it responds quickly
- ✓ Have example email/article/code ready

**Recording tools:**
- Use QuickTime (free) or Screen Studio (paid, adds automatic zoom/effects)
- Record at 1920x1080 or higher
- 30fps is fine

**Post-production:**
- Speed up "old way" to 1.5x
- Add text overlays at timestamps above
- Add subtle zoom/highlight on button clicks
- Add keyboard overlay showing "Cmd+Shift+C" when pressed
- Keep it under 45 seconds total

### Text Overlays (exact copy)

```
[0:00] "I was doing this 50+ times a day..."
[0:12] "So I built Seeva"
[0:30] "Works everywhere"
[0:42] "Seeva - AI assistant that's always there"
       "Open Source • Privacy-Focused • Mac"
       "github.com/[your-link]"
```

---

### Questions to Type in Video (keep them short!)

✓ "Make this sound professional"
✓ "Explain this simply"
✓ "What does this button do?"
✓ "Fix this error"

❌ Don't use long questions (hard to read in video)

---

### Pro Tips

1. **Smooth cursor movements** - practice the flow a few times
2. **Pause briefly** after each action (gives viewers time to process)
3. **Show Cmd+Shift+C clearly** - use keyboard overlay or text
4. **Keep Seeva window in same position** throughout video
5. **Use real content** - real email, real article (makes it authentic)
6. **Don't rush** the Seeva demo - show it's actually fast naturally

---

### Alternative: Super Simple Version (30 seconds)

If 45 seconds feels long:

```
[0:00-0:10] Show problem once (old way)
[0:10-0:25] Show solution (Seeva way)
[0:25-0:30] End screen with link
```

Skip the "works everywhere" montage, just show one strong use case (email is most relatable).

---

### Where to Post Video

1. **LinkedIn** - upload directly (better reach than links)
2. **Twitter/X** - native upload
3. **YouTube Shorts** - for discoverability
4. **Reddit** - r/SideProject, r/MacApps (after a few days)

**Don't:**
- ❌ Link to external video on LinkedIn (kills reach)
- ✓ Upload directly to each platform
